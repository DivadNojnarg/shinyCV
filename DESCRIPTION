Description: Build beautiful CVs with shiny and adminLTE2. You can choose two 
        different approaches: fill your CV using the shiny builder App and export
        it in the shiny cv viewer; or feed your cv with your own data structures 
        (see help) to send them directly to the shiny cv viewer. The shiny cv viewer is a
        shiny App so it is possible to host it either in your own shiny server (open-source
        or pro) or in shinyapps.io, so that external user can see your new cv.
